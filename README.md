# kalman-aby-combined-filter
A java program used to test various settings of a data filter similar to a one dimensional Kalman filter, but with some additional equations from the alpha-beta-gamma filter

In the Output directory, there is a file called "data.csv". This file is used to output the data of the Combined Filter once it is tuned.
The files besides "CombinedFilter.java" and "CombinedFilterRecord.java" (contained in the src directory) are used to compile and run "CombinedFilterRecord.java" so that it can write data to a file (data.csv).
